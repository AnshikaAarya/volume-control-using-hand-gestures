# Volume Control Using Hand Gestures


## 🚀 Overview

This project implements a volume control system using hand gestures. By detecting hand movements through a camera, the system adjusts the volume of your computer without the need for physical controls. It leverages computer vision techniques, specifically hand landmark detection, to recognize gestures and translate them into volume control actions.

The project is built using **Python** and utilizes **OpenCV** for image processing, along with **Mediapipe** for detecting hand landmarks.


## 🎯 Features

- **Real-time hand gesture detection** using OpenCV and MediaPipe.
- **Volume control**: Increase or decrease system volume based on the distance between fingers.
- **Visual feedback**: A real-time overlay showing gesture detection on the video feed.
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## 📦 Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- Mediapipe
- Pycaw (for controlling system volume on Windows)
- NumPy

You can install these dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy pycaw
```

## 💻 Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/volume-control-hand-gestures.git
   ```

2. **Navigate into the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd volume-control-hand-gestures
   ```

3. **Install required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the script:**

   ```bash
   python volume_control.py
   ```

## 🛠 How It Works

1. **Hand Detection**: The system uses **Mediapipe's Hand Landmarks** model to detect and track the hand in real-time through a webcam feed.
   
2. **Gesture Recognition**: The distance between the thumb and index finger is calculated. When this distance changes, the system interprets it as a volume control action (e.g., closer = lower volume, farther apart = higher volume).

3. **Volume Control**: Using **Pycaw** (on Windows) or appropriate libraries for other operating systems, the detected gesture is translated into system volume adjustments.

## 📷 Example Gestures

- **Increase Volume**: Spread your thumb and index finger apart.
- **Decrease Volume**: Bring your thumb and index finger closer together.
